On Sign-Up:

1. Workspace and a User is created
2. The user is made the admin of th Workspace
3. A role called Admin is created by default


Every Workspace has a workspaceId

Every user will belong to Workspace (determined using workspaceId)
    - Users can sign up and not join a workspace or create one. In which case they will only be at workspace selection screen

Every user will have a field called roleId which will define the current role of the User

Role schema will contain all active role (as well as custom role, if possible). UId is roleId.

Every workspace can have separate custom roles. So combination of workspaceId and roleId act as UID

ACL schema holds all permission to user with role: <roleId> and workspace: <workspaceId>
